# Bhattacharyya Metrics
The provided implementations of the BhattacharyyaMetrics and KLDivergence classes are general-purpose and don't make any specific assumptions about their usage beyond what's stated in their respective docstrings and methods. However, here are some general considerations and guidelines to keep in mind when using these classes:

Input Assumptions:

For the BhattacharyyaMetrics class, the assumption is that you're working with multivariate normal distributions and have the means and covariance matrices as input.
For the KLDivergence class, the assumption is that you have probability distributions p and q as input.
Data Consistency:

Ensure that the dimensions of input data are consistent with the expected shapes for both classes. For example, the means and covariance matrices for the BhattacharyyaMetrics class should match in shape, and the p and q distributions for the KLDivergence class should also have the same shape.
Zero Probabilities:

For the KLDivergence class, be aware of cases where probabilities are zero. The KL Divergence calculation involves a logarithm, so zero probabilities may lead to undefined results. You can handle these cases by using np.where or adding a small epsilon to the probabilities.
Contextual Use:

These classes are meant to be generic and modular. Adapt them to your specific use case by passing appropriate data and interpreting the calculated metrics within the context of your problem.
Performance:

These implementations are relatively straightforward and aimed at providing a clear understanding. If performance is a concern, you might want to optimize calculations using vectorization or specialized libraries.
Data Type:

Ensure that the data you provide (means, covariance matrices, probabilities) are of numeric types (floats) as these calculations involve mathematical operations.
Testing:

Before using these classes in critical applications, consider testing them on known inputs to ensure they're functioning as expected.
Remember that these classes provide foundational functionality. Depending on your application, you might need to extend or modify them to fit more specific requirements.
